## Salient Points - 
### EOS Resources - 
Computational (CPU), Bandwidth (NET), RAM (Storage) 
### RAM discussion - 
* storage on the network
* speculators bought all of them
* it peaked 0.92 EOS/KB of RAM
* account creation - 4KB of RAM
* Airdrops free on genesis snapshot for already registered a/c
* 15k USD for launching airdrops.
* 15 USD for one account.
* In future, EOS account will be universal one.
* Solutions - the ability to profit/loss out of staking should be eliminated.
* EOS price is being hurt due to RAM price. Bcoz one has to buy EOS tokens to buy ram.
* @dan solution - taxation on the profit from RAM
* To increase the ram supply - sidechains.
* sidechain - branch of tree,  mainnet- main trunk of tree.
* 1 GB of RAM has been hit with contracts - airdrop
* the transaction fees (extra tokens) for RAM trading is getting burnt. This is negating the inflation (5% per year).
### Airdrops, Funding, Inflation
* airdrops on mainchain, but running on sidechain. BPs to process both mainchain and sidechain txns.
* Due to txn fee for RAM, inflation is -2 (negative). And the extra tokens getting burnt. This is how the inflation is negative.
* Block.one's 10 year commitment for EOS. 10 millions getting generated per year.
* Everipedia funded by EOS VC. Need to find if they airdrop to the Block.one :P
### Voting
* more than 30% except block.one.
* Greymass deserve in 21-list. Features- buy/sell ram, proxy-voting.
* Cypherglass has 37 million EOS tokens voting. Some whales might have shifted the voting.
* Min. 50 good nodes should be always ready all the time.
* IPFS, multithreading needs more redundancy.
* proxy-voting. BPs are not allowed to do that. otherwise, they would vote themselves.
### Identity
* Biometric, retina, fingerprint will be activated for unique identity.
* Otherwise, voting might be manipulated. One person (with staked EOS), one vote.
* @dan working on a new consensus mechanism for ID.
* account recovery - eos42, diff. b/w owner & active keys.
* In genesis, owner & active key are the same. One can use the owner key to change the active key.
  <br/> It is also recommended to create separate active key through storing offline. Greymass is working on this.
